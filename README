This is my game based on tutorial in http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/

This source cover adding the sprites, moving the sprites, and collision based on square bound.

Because this game created with cocos2d-x, so, this is C++ project :)

Ah, and the code of the game is in HelloWorldScene.cpp and HelloWorldScene.h


Hope you like it :D


Best Regards
